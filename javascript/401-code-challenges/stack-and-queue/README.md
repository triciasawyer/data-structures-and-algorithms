# Code challenge 10-11

## Challenge Title

- Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.
- Create a new class called pseudo queue that utilizes 2 stack methods, enqueue and dequeue, to create and manage the queue

## Whiteboard process

## Approach and Efficiency

My BigO:

Stack
time: O(1)
space: O(1)

Queue
time: O(1)
space: O(1)

PseudoQueue
time: O(n) -> enqueue
time: O(1) -> dequeue
space: O(n)

## Collaborators

- Worked on code challenge 10 with Ryan in lecture.
- Code challenge 11 was just me, due to unavailability
