# Code challenge 31

## Feature Tasks

- Find common values in 2 binary trees
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters. Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

### Structure and Testing

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
