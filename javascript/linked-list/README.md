# code challenge 5

## Challenge Title

 Linekd list. Creating classes to manipulate a linked list with nodes.

## Whiteboard Process

Not needed for this challenge

## Approach & Efficiency

I researched a lot and rewatched class clecture to better understand node, as this was a new concept.

My BigO:

insert
time = O(1)
space = O(n)

includes
time = O(n)
space = O(1)

toString
time = O(n)
space = O(n)

append
time = O(n)
space = O(n)

insertBefore
time = O(n)
space = O(n)

insertAfter
time = O(n)
space = O(n)

delete
time = O(n)
space = O(1)
