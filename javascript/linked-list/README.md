## Approach & Efficiency

I researched a lot and rewatched class clecture to better understand node, as this was a new concept.

My BigO:

insert
time: O(1)
space: O(n)

includes
time: O(n)
space: O(1)

toString
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

append
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

insertBefore
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

insertAfter
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

delete
time: O(n)
space: O(1)

kthFromEnd
time: O(n)
space: O(1)

ZipLists
time: O(n)
space: O(1)

ZipSort
time: O(n)
space: O(1)
